# **Contextualized Query Expansion via Unsupervised Chunk Selection (CQE-UCS)**

This project demonstrates the use of a custom algorithm, **Contextualized Query Expansion via Unsupervised Chunk Selection (CQE-UCS)**, to optimize the information retrieval process using LangChain and Pinecone. The system enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by selecting the most relevant text chunks and expanding queries in a context-aware manner, providing more accurate and contextually rich responses.

## **Overview**
This project addresses challenges in modern information retrieval by enhancing the query expansion process. By employing **unsupervised chunk selection**, the system can identify and utilize the most relevant information within a given dataset, thus improving the retrieval process. The framework leverages **LangChain** to expand the queries and uses **Pinecone** to perform vector-based searches for relevant documents.

## **Features**
- **Contextualized Query Expansion**: The system expands queries based on the context of the retrieved information, improving the relevance of results.
- **Unsupervised Chunk Selection**: Automatically selects relevant text chunks for query expansion without the need for labeled data.
- **Efficient Vector Search**: Uses **Pinecone** to perform high-dimensional vector searches for fast and accurate document retrieval.
- **Flexible Integration**: Designed to work with existing RAG models, allowing easy integration into existing AI-powered retrieval systems.
- **Improved Response Accuracy**: By focusing on context, the system generates responses that are not only accurate but also highly informative.

## **Installation**
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or above
- Pinecone account and API key
- OpenAI account and API key

### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CQE-UCS.git
    cd CQE-UCS
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up Pinecone and OpenAI API keys:**
    - Sign up for Pinecone [here](https://www.pinecone.io/) and OpenAI [here](https://openai.com/).
    - Create a `.env` file with the following:
    ```bash
    PINECONE_API_KEY=<Your-Pinecone-API-Key>
    PINECONE_ENV=<Your-Pinecone-Environment>
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your-OpenAI-API-Key>
    ```

## **Usage**
After installation, you can run the CQE-UCS algorithm by following these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure you have documents to feed into the system for query retrieval.
2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Query Example**: You can input your query such as:
    ```python
    query = "What are the features of the TechCo Smart Home Hub?"
    ```
   The system will retrieve relevant chunks from your dataset and return a contextually rich response.

## **How It Works**
### **CQE-UCS Algorithm**
**Contextualized Query Expansion via Unsupervised Chunk Selection** expands user queries by identifying relevant text chunks within documents. It does so using **unsupervised learning** to avoid needing labeled training data.

### **LangChain**
**LangChain** handles the query expansion and natural language processing, helping to refine the search query by integrating additional context or terms that improve retrieval accuracy.

### **Pinecone**
**Pinecone** is used as the vector database for storing and retrieving documents based on vector similarity search. Each document and query is transformed into a vector embedding, allowing for fast and efficient document retrieval.

### **OpenAI Embeddings**
OpenAIâ€™s embedding models are used to represent both the documents and the queries in high-dimensional vector space. This allows for semantic similarity searches rather than keyword-based ones.

### **RAG Model**
The system is built on the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework, where retrieved chunks are passed into a language model (such as GPT) to generate contextually accurate and rich responses.

## **Technologies**
- **LangChain**: Natural language processing for query expansion.
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for document storage and retrieval.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Semantic representation of queries and documents.
- **RAG Model**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual responses.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Git**: Version control.
